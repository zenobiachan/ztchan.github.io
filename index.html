Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://politics.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>. I study the international and domestic politics of economic statecraft. 
</p>

<p>
My dissertation book project investigates how positive economic statecraft––such as foreign aid, loans, and investment––work in influencing preferences and behavior of elites and public abroad. Drawing on insights from behavioral economics, political psychology, and the domestic politics of foreign policy, I propose a unifying framework to explain the effectiveness of various types of positive economic statecraft based on their cost contingency and time horizon. I combine archival materials, elite interviews, experimental data, and large-<i>N</i> statistical analysis to test my theory in three sets of cases with substantial policy implications: Chinese foreign aid and infrastructure projects in Africa, Chinese support for the Euro during the European debt crisis, and the Baltic States’ arms trades with their NATO security partners. 
</p>

<p>
My other <a href="./research">research projects</a> examine the effects of information operations on voter polarization and develop machine learning techniques for discovering heterogeneous treatment effects. 
</p>

<p>
Much of my research is inspired by my background in international affairs, public policy, and software engineering. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was an analyst and geo-data engineer at Google, Inc. I have also served analyst and consultant positions at the United Nations, OECD, and World Bank on issues related to development assistance, energy policy, and infrastructure financing. 
</p>

<p>
I hold a Master of International Affairs in International Security Policy from <a href="https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, an MA <i>summa cum laude</i> in International Economic Policy from <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/" target="_blank">Sciences Po Paris</a>, and a BBA (1st Hon) in International Business and Global Management from <a href="https://hku.hk/" target="_blank">the University of Hong Kong</a>.
